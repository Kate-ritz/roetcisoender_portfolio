    "text": "Kate Roetcisoender\nI am an undergraduate student at Cal State University, Monterey Bay majoring in marine science and minoring in statistics, and graduating in Spring 2025. I have worked in Dr. James Lindholm’s Image Analysis and Fish Ecology Lab for almost three years and have extensive experience in the field, analyzing video, and data processing.   I grew up in the Mojave desert with few visits to the ocean, but still managed to find my passion for marine science. I have since moved to Monterey, California, where I get to see the ocean everyday, as well as work towards long-term monitoring solutions to understand the health of fish communities worldwide. I have been working on an independent project under Dr. James Lindholm analyzing the relative merits of various forms of video data collection, with the hopes of submitting for publication shortly after graduation. Additionally, I have been assisting in the virtual reality (VR) diving program, which has allowed me to participate in bringing underwater footage to high school classrooms to teach about marine science, marine protected areas, and research diving. Through all of these experiences, I have fallen further in love with marine science and the ocean, and plan to pursue making a difference for the rest of my life."

Or remove information from variable values?\nYes, OpCode will need to be reclassified as categorical, not numeric.\n2.

Do you need to filter your data? How?\nNo\n4. Do you need to create any new variables? What variables? How?\nYes, I would like to create a species richness variable by grouping by drop then counting the unique species, then joining that table to the drop data. I would also like to create an average fish length variable by grouping by drop then calculating the mean of lengths and joining that to the drop data.\n5. Do you need to add new data (join) to your data? What data? How?\nSee above question. The data added comes from the same sampling effort, but looks at individual fish instead of the overall drop.\n6. Are there any variables you can exclude from your data?\nYes, date and one of the diversity indices can be excluded.\n7. Do you need pivot your data in any way? Why? How?\nNo.\n8. Do you need to summarize any of the variables? Which ones? How?\nSee question 4.\n9. What other aspects of your data need to be “fixed” in order to make your data visualizations?\nNone (hopefully)."

    "text": "Data Description\nThese datasets are from a summer of data collected in 2023, with the purpose of assessing the possible impacts of marine protected areas (MPAs) on the fish communities they protect. That summer, the Lindholm lab and I completed four week long data collection trips at four different MPAs along California’s central and north coast. We deployed stereo camera systems for 45 minutes each, then took that video back to the lab and spent the fall collecting fish data from it. Stereo video specifically uses two cameras to triangulate objects where the frames overlap, allowing us to measure fish down to the millimeter without ever touching them. These data were eventually processed and submitted to inform MPA management.\nHere is the data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KVd_7IsOHM9Xe1PDIf47Q4LnQt4J6QFjS5UL1i_GzpA/edit?gid=0#gid=0\nSheets:\n\nDrop_data - information on each camera system deployment \n3D_points - Each individual fish counted \nLengths - The precise measurement of each fish able to be measured\n\nVariables:\n\nDrop_ID - sample (drop) identifier \nDate - YYYYMMDD, when the video was taken \nLocation - the marine protected area that was sampled \nDesignation - whether the video was taken inside the MPA or outside (REF) \n3D Points - number of fish counted in drop \n3D Lengths - number of fish measured in drop \nDepth (m) - depth of drop in meters \nSimpson_div - Gini-Simpson diversity index \nShannon_div - Shannon-Wiener diversity index\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\nFor the first visualization, I started with the 3D_points data and pulled out just the columns\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2"
